## Description

The purpose of this project was use Inquirer, Jest, and Node.js to create a svg logo creator application. The main focus was to use do so with the method of object-oriented programming. This was achieved through class constructor functions used to help create the logo. Tests were also run to make sure the class constructor functions were working as intended. This project helped reinforce understanding of using Jest, which is an important for any developer wanting to make sure their code is running as perfect as possible. creating this application with the mindset of object-oriented programming also helped me realize that there are many ways to create an application.

## Installation

To run the tests and the application itself, the user must first clone the repository, and then install the required packages by typing in the console "npm install".

## Usage

To use the application, you must first install the required packages. After that, you will need to type "node index.js" to initialize the application. Once you have done so, you will see a series of questions you will need to answer by typing in the console. After the questions have been successfully answered, you should see in the console "'Generated logo.svg!". You will also notice that there is a new file called logo.svg in the root directory. simply open up the folder with a preview extension or open it up with google chrome to see your new logo!
